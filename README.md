# SPPf Application
The Single Patch *Plasmodium falciparum* (SPPf) tool is disease modelling software that simulates  *Plasmodium falciparum* malaria transmission for a population of interest. The software allows the user to simulate health policies and intervention strategies, alone and in combination, to determine the impact on malaria incidence. 

The tool has been developed in the RShiny Application framework and requires that you install R, RStudio and related packages to run the software. 
To use the tool, please download all files in the Tool Code folder, and run the app.R file in RStudio.

*Important Disclaimer:*
All models are simplifications of reality. Whilst every effort has been taken during the development of this tool/model for it to be as accurate and reliable as possible it is important that the user understands that the outputs are a prediction based on the assumptions chosen through the input parameter values. The output of the model should be used to explore multiple scenarios and in combination with a larger evidence base during decision-making.

The appropriate use of this tool/model and its output can contribute to effective policymaking, but misuse or misinterpretation of the output can mislead decision-making. Any decisions taken whilst using these tools are the responsibility of the user and no liability whatsoever will be taken by the developers/authors of the tool.
