There are six main steps to using the SPPf model:  
1. Input the baseline data for your population (manually/upload).  
2. Perform model calibration to allow the model to mimic the input data.  
3. Select interventions at desired coverage levels to building strategies.  
4. Compare the impact and cost of selected strategies on malaria outcomes.  
5. Run a sensitivity analysis on model outputs.  
6. Download figures and model data for further analysis.
